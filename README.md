A bootstrapped version of Slim framework configured with templating, ORM support, and Twitter Bootstrap because I was sick and tired of rolling a new PHP framework for every small project.

## Get Started
Update config.php to reflect your site's settings.

Check out routes/example.php to see an example route file. All files in the routes directory are included by default.

The static/ directory contains Twitter Bootstrap's files.

The templates/ directory is searched by Twig/Slim when templates are rendered.

The vendor/ directory contains all the external libraries used by bootcut.
